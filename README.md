# GitHub.nim

GitHub.nim provides a nim interface to the [GitHub API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/). Using GitHub.nim, you can do things like:

- query for basic repository, organization, and user information
- programmatically take user-level actions (e.g. starring a repository, commenting on an issue, etc.)
- set up listeners that can detect and respond to repository events
- create and retrieve commit statuses (i.e. report CI pending/failure/success statuses to GitHub)
